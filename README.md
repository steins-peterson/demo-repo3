# demo-repo3 
I've learnt that while creating a repo directly on GitHub, we don't have to use git add to stage the changes, coz github directly does it for us.

On the other hand if we code in text editor and we need to push that particular repo to github, then we use add, commit, then push. 

If we don't have access rights to the file we are using, then we make a pull request which is something used for a code review and some other stuff.
